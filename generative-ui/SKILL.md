# Generative UI Skill

This is a **Claude Artifact-style generator skill** designed for the current environment (iSH).

The goal is not to modify the chat host itself, but to:

1. Organize user instructions into a structured spec
2. Render them with Python into a single-file HTML artifact
3. Save it to `<workspace>/`
4. Let users preview, share, and continue iterating directly

## Automatic Trigger Scenarios

Use this skill first when users express any of the following intentions:

- "Create a Claude Artifact / Claude-style page"
- "Turn the answer into cards"
- "Generate a table / record sheet / checklist"
- "Organize the content into a timeline"
- "Generate a code block display page"
- "Create a chart / visualization page"
- "Render this content as an HTML prototype"
- "Create an interactive explanation page / artifact"

In particular, when the user also mentions:
**cards, tables, records, code blocks, timelines, charts, visualization pages, artifacts**
assume by default that this skill should be invoked to generate an additional page.

## Currently Supported Unified Components

- `cards`: information cards / KPI cards
- `table`: table
- `records`: record list
- `timeline`: timeline / step flow
- `code`: code block
- `chart`: built-in bar chart
- `details`: collapsible details

## Main Scripts

### 1) Complete Artifact Generator

```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/generative_ui_artifact.py \
  "Weekly Project Report" \
  --text "Need overview cards\nNeed risk table\nNeed timeline\nNeed code block\nNeed chart"
```

By default, this outputs to:

```bash
<workspace>/<title>_artifact.html
```

### 2) Render from a JSON spec

```bash
python3 <skill-path>/scripts/generative_ui_artifact.py \
  "Demo" \
  --spec /path/to/spec.json \
  --out <workspace>/demo_artifact.html \
  --json-out <workspace>/demo_spec.json
```

## spec Format

```json
{
  "title": "Generative UI Example",
  "summary": "Unified output of multiple components.",
  "chips": ["Artifact", "Cards", "Table"],
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "cards",
      "title": "Overview Cards",
      "items": [
        {"title": "Status", "value": "In Progress", "desc": "In the current iteration"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "table",
      "title": "Record Sheet",
      "columns": ["Date", "Item", "Status"],
      "rows": [["03-17", "Generator Development", "Done"]]
    },
    {
      "type": "timeline",
      "title": "Timeline",
      "items": [
        {"title": "Phase One", "desc": "Requirements Organization"},
        {"title": "Phase Two", "desc": "Page Rendering"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "code",
      "title": "Sample Code",
      "language": "python",
      "content": "print('hello artifact')"
    },
    {
      "type": "chart",
      "title": "Progress Chart",
      "series": [
        {"label": "Design", "value": 70},
        {"label": "Development", "value": 85}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Determine whether the user needs an artifact page
2. If the input is only a natural-language description, first use the script to automatically infer the basic blocks
3. If the content is complex, organize it into a JSON spec before rendering
4. After generating the HTML, send the workspace link directly to the user
5. Continue modifying the spec or template based on feedback

## Capability Boundaries

**Can do:**
- Generate a unified single-file artifact HTML
- Support cards, tables, records, timelines, code blocks, and charts
- Serve as a visual supplement to an answer

**Does not directly do yet:**
- Native message-level component injection into the chat host
- Complex frontend applications driven by real-time databases
- Long-running interactive server-side services

## Trigger Recommendations

If the user says:
- "Make me a card version"
- "Also generate a table/timeline/code block"
- "Organize it into an artifact page"

Do not respond with text only. Run this skill directly to generate an additional HTML artifact.
