### Summary

The script lacks execute permission when initializing `self-improving-agent`

### Details

In the current environment, this script should be called explicitly with `sh` to avoid a "Permission denied" error. Prefer `sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh init`.

### Summary

The default location for learning logs has been changed to `workspace/learnings`

### Details

The hidden directory `.learnings` has poor visibility in cross-project search and file selection scenarios. The default has been changed to `<workspace>/learnings`. At the same time, `--project` project-level isolation and `--base` custom paths are retained, creating a dual track of shared accumulated learnings and project isolation.
