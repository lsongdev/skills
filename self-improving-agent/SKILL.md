# Self-Improvement Skill

This skill is used in the current environment to **record errors, corrections, and reusable best practices**, creating a traceable learning loop.

## Directory Conventions

- **Working directory**: `<workspace>/`
- **Default learning log directory for this skill**: `~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/data/`
- **Public learning log directory within this skill (after promotion)**: `~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/data/public/`
- **Project-level learning log directory (optional)**: `<project>/.learnings/`
- **Learning log files**:
  - `LEARNINGS.md` (corrections, knowledge gaps, best practices)
  - `ERRORS.md` (command failures, exception output)
  - `FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` (new capabilities requested by users)

> By default, log entries go first to the skill's own `data` directory. When you explicitly specify a project, write to the project-level log. When an issue has been abstracted into a cross-project rule, promote it to the skill's public area or the memory system.

## Current Final Rules

- **Default logging location**: `~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/data/`
- **Public area within the skill**: `~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/data/public/`
- **Project-level logging**: Use `<project>/.learnings/` only when `--project <path>` is passed explicitly
- **Recommended public parameter**: `--public`
- **Compatibility alias**: `--workspace` is still available, but only for compatibility and is no longer recommended
- **Promotion behavior**: `promote <entryID>` copies the entry to the public area within the skill, automatically marks the source entry as `promoted`, and writes back `**Promoted to**` and `### Resolution Record`
- **Duplicate protection**: If the entry already exists in the skill's public area, running `promote` again will not append a duplicate

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Command or operation fails | Log to the skill directory by default: `data/ERRORS.md` |
| The user corrects you | Log to the skill directory by default: `data/LEARNINGS.md`, category `correction` |
| The user needs a missing capability | Log to the skill directory by default: `data/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` |
| Project context is explicitly specified | Log to `<project>/.learnings/` |
| External API or tool fails | Log to `ERRORS.md` in the current scope, including integration details |
| Knowledge is outdated | Log to `LEARNINGS.md` in the current scope, category `knowledge_gap` |
| A better solution is found | First log it to the current scope, then promote it after confirming it is generally applicable |
| Similar issues recur across multiple projects | Promote to the public area within the skill: `data/public/` |
| Similar to an existing entry | Link with `**See Also**` and consider raising the priority |
| Widely applicable experience | Promote to the public area within the skill or to the memory system. See "Promoting to the Memory System" below |

## Trigger Logging Rules

> Note: By default, this skill **does not automatically listen in the background**. When trigger conditions are met, the assistant (or you) should actively call `scripts/auto_log.sh` to write the log to disk.

### Recommended Triggers That "Must Be Logged"

If any of the following conditions are met, the event should be logged unless you explicitly say "do not log it":

1. **A command or operation fails and the cause is not obvious**: For example, permissions, paths, dependencies, network issues, or third-party API exceptions that require investigation to diagnose.
2. **User correction**: You point out where my understanding is wrong, where my logic does not match the actual behavior of this software, or where paths or conventions are incorrect.
3. **Knowledge update or outdated assumption correction**: A previous assumption is found not to apply to the current environment, or documentation or implementation needs correction.
4. **Reusable better solution**: A stable practice, convention, template, or workflow emerges that can significantly reduce rework.
5. **Recurring pattern**: Similar issues appear repeatedly within the same task, or across tasks or projects.

### Situations That Generally Should Not Be Logged

- Ordinary chat, one-off small changes, or minor details with no reuse value.
- You explicitly ask "do not log this."

### Recommended Logging Location

- **By default**, write to the skill area `data/` first.
- After confirming that the entry has reuse value across tasks, use `promote` to move it to the public area within the skill: `data/public/`.

## Difference from the Memory System and Promotion Criteria

### Difference (Suggested Interpretation)

- This skill's logs (`data/` and `data/public/`) are an **editable work review repository**: they record context, troubleshooting processes, and solution evolution, and they allow long text and details.
- The memory system (`memory_write` writing to `<memory>/`) is for **cross-session long-term rules and preferences**: entries should be short, stable, and reusable. Poorly written entries can "pollute" future decisions for a long time.

### Where to Write (Log First, Then Refine into Memory)

- **Write to this skill's logs first**: When the content needs context, such as error output, troubleshooting paths, or solution comparisons; when it is not yet clear whether it is generally applicable; or when it is still being iterated on.
- **Then promote to memory**: When the conclusion is stable, applies across tasks or skills, and can be expressed in one sentence.

### When to Promote to Memory (Hard Criteria)

Consider `memory_write` only if at least one of the following is true:

1. It can be condensed into a rule of the form "**When X happens in the future, do Y**" and does not depend on specific project details.
2. It **recurs 3 or more times within 30 days**, or appears in at least **2 different tasks or domains**.
3. It clearly belongs to your long-term preferences or conventions, such as tool usage constraints, path conventions, or output format rules, and you explicitly say "remember this" or "do this from now on."

### Recommended Promotion Actions

- First use `promote` to promote the entry to the public area within the skill, `data/public/`, for higher visibility and easier review.
- Then distill 1 to 3 short rules from the public entry and write them to the day's memory with `memory_write`.

Usage examples:

```bash
# By default, write to the skill's own data directory
sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh init

# Log a skill-level learning
sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh learning "Fixed the download timeout" "Use chunking and retries"

# If you need to log explicitly at the project level, pass --project
sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh --project <workspace>/my-project error "curl request failed" "HTTP 429"

# If you need to write directly to the public area within the skill, pass --public explicitly
sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh --public feature "Support batch export" "Operations needs daily reports"

# Search the skill area + project area + public area within the skill
sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh search timeout

# Promote an entry to the public area within the skill
sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh promote LRN-20260317-ABC

# View the current scope
sh ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent/scripts/auto_log.sh status
```

---
```

## ID Generation Rules

Format: `TYPE-YYYYMMDD-XXX`

- TYPE: `LRN` (learning), `ERR` (error), `FEAT` (feature)
- YYYYMMDD: current date
- XXX: sequential number or random 3-character value, such as `001` or `A7B`

Examples: `LRN-20250115-001`, `ERR-20250115-A3F`, `FEAT-20250115-002`

## Resolving Entries

After an issue is fixed, update the entry:

1. Change `**Status**: pending` to `**Status**: resolved`
2. Add a resolution block after the metadata:

```markdown
### Resolution Record
- **Resolution time**: 2025-01-16T09:00:00Z
- **Commit/PR**: abc123 or #42
- **Notes**: Brief description of what was done
```

Other statuses:

- `in_progress` - Being worked on
- `wont_fix` - Decided not to fix. Write the reason in the resolution record
- `promoted` - Promoted to the memory system

## Promoting to the Memory System

When a learning item is broadly applicable rather than a one-time fix, it should be promoted to the memory system.

### When to Promote

- The learning applies across multiple files or features
- Any contributor, human or AI, should know it
- It prevents repeated mistakes
- It records project conventions

### Promotion Targets

- **Daily memory**: `<memory>/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (written through `memory_write`)
- **Global memory**: `<memory>/GLOBAL.md` (read-only; the user must maintain it in settings)
- **Project notes**: Recommended target: `<workspace>/PROJECT_NOTES.md`

### How to Promote

1. **Distill**: Condense the learning into concise rules or facts
2. **Write**: Use `memory_write` to write to daily memory, and sync to project notes if needed
3. **Write back**: Update the original entry:
   - `**Status**: pending` to `**Status**: promoted`
   - Add `**Promoted**: YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `PROJECT_NOTES.md`

## Recurring Pattern Detection

If the content being logged is similar to an existing entry:

1. **Search first**: `grep -r "keyword" <workspace>/.learnings/`
2. **Create an association**: Add `**See Also**: ERR-20250110-001` to the metadata
3. **Raise the priority**: If the issue recurs
4. **Consider a systematic fix**: Recurring issues usually indicate:
   - Missing documentation (write to `PROJECT_NOTES.md` or daily memory)
   - Missing automation (add scripts or toolchain support)
   - Architectural issues (create a technical debt task)

## Simplify & Harden Feed

Used to ingest recurring patterns from the `simplify-and-harden` skill and convert them into persistent prompt rules.

### Ingestion Workflow

1. Read `simplify_and_harden.learning_loop.candidates` from the task summary.
2. For each candidate, use `pattern_key` as the stable deduplication key.
3. Search `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` to see whether it already exists:
   - `grep -n "Pattern-Key: <pattern_key>" <workspace>/.learnings/LEARNINGS.md`
4. If it already exists:
   - Increment `Recurrence-Count`
   - Update `Last-Seen`
   - Add a `See Also` association
5. If it does not exist:
   - Create a new `LRN-...` entry
   - Set `Source: simplify-and-harden`
   - Set `Pattern-Key`, `Recurrence-Count: 1`, and `First-Seen`/`Last-Seen`

### Promotion Rules (System Prompt Feedback)

When the following conditions are met, promote the recurring pattern to the memory system:

- `Recurrence-Count >= 3`
- Appears in at least 2 different tasks
- Occurs within 30 days

The promoted rule should be a **short and clear preventive rule** that describes what to do before or during work, not a lengthy incident review.

## Periodic Review

Review `.learnings/` at natural milestones:

### When to Review

- Before starting a new important task
- After completing a feature
- When entering a domain that has previous learnings
- Once a week during active development

### Quick Status Check

```bash
# Count pending items
grep -h "Status\*\*: pending" <workspace>/.learnings/*.md | wc -l

# List pending high-priority items
grep -B5 "Priority\*\*: high" <workspace>/.learnings/*.md | grep "^## \["

# Find learnings for a specific area
grep -l "Domain\*\*: backend" <workspace>/.learnings/*.md
```
