description: >
  General GitHub basic operations + automation for GitHub platform objects (Issues/Labels/Milestones/Releases/Actions) in the current environment. This skill must be triggered when the user mentions any basic Git/GitHub operation or workflow, including "how to use GitHub," clone, init, remote, branch, commit, push, pull, fetch, merge, rebase, tag, release, issues, actions, labels, milestone, protected branches, fork, PR, sync to upstream, delete branches, restore after emptying a directory, push directly to main, or one-click sync.
compatibility: >
  Requires git, python3. Uses env GITHUB_TOKEN for GitHub API + HTTPS push (non-interactive via GIT_ASKPASS).

## Objectives

Codify GitHub/Git "basic operations" and common collaboration workflows into:

1) A clear command quick reference (explanation + when to use)
2) Executable one-click scripts (to avoid repetitive manual steps)
3) Common outputs that are "numbered" whenever possible, so the user can reply with a number to choose an item directly, such as from a repository list

## Security and Constraints (Must Be Followed)

| No. | Rule | Reason |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | **Do not output tokens**: No command may echo or print `$GITHUB_TOKEN` to stdout | Prevent leaks |
| 2 | **Require a second confirmation for dangerous operations**: deleting branches, emptying directories, forced overwrites, force pushes, and direct pushes to main | These operations are hard to reverse |
| 3 | Use "branch + PR" collaboration by default; only "push directly to main" when the user explicitly requests it | Reduce the risk of damaging the main branch |
| 4 | Run `git status` before push/pull | Prevent accidental commits or overwrites |

## How to Run

- **Script entry point**: `sh ~/.agents/skills/github-sync-helper/scripts/gh_sync.sh <command> [options]`

> The script runs in the "current Git repository directory" and must be run inside a repository.

## Quick Reference for Basic Git/GitHub Operations (Explanation + Corresponding Script)

| No. | Category | Operation | One-sentence explanation | Common command | Script support |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Initialize | init | Turn the current directory into a Git repository | `git init` | `init` |
| 2 | Get code | clone | Download a repository from a remote to local | `git clone <url>` | `clone` |
| 3 | Remote | remote | Manage remotes such as origin/upstream | `git remote -v/add/set-url/remove` | `remotes/add-remote/add-upstream/set-remote-url/remove-remote` |
| 4 | Branch | branch | View, create, or delete branches | `git branch -a/-d/-D` | `branches/create-branch/delete-branches` |
| 5 | Switch | checkout/switch | Switch to a branch | `git switch <b>` | `checkout` |
| 6 | View changes | status/diff/log | View working tree changes, diffs, or history | `git status` `git diff` `git log` | `status/diff/log` |
| 7 | Stage | add | Add changes to the staging area | `git add -A` | `add` |
| 8 | Commit | commit | Package the staging area into a commit | `git commit -m "..."` | `commit` |
| 9 | Sync | fetch/pull/push | Fetch, merge, or push commits | `git fetch` `git pull` `git push` | `fetch/pull/push/push-main` |
|10| Merge | merge/rebase | Merge branch history | `git merge` `git rebase` | `merge/rebase` (use with caution) |
|11| Stash | stash | Temporarily set aside uncommitted changes | `git stash` | `stash` |
|12| Tag | tag | Add a version tag to a commit | `git tag` | `tag` |
|13| Submodule | submodule | Manage subrepository dependencies | `git submodule` | `submodule` |
|15| GitHub platform | issues/labels/milestones/releases/actions | Manage platform objects through the GitHub API | (API) | `gh-issues-list` and others (see below) |

> Note: The script is intended to "turn common basic operations into reusable commands." For complex rebases or conflicts, using an interactive terminal is still recommended.

## Typical Workflows (Examples)

### 1) Push directly to main: empty directory -> restore directory -> push (the workflow you just used)

```bash
sh ~/.agents/skills/github-sync-helper/scripts/gh_sync.sh empty-dir --dir self-improving-agent
sh ~/.agents/skills/github-sync-helper/scripts/gh_sync.sh restore-dir --src ~/.agents/skills/self-improving-agent --dst self-improving-agent
sh ~/.agents/skills/github-sync-helper/scripts/gh_sync.sh commit --message "restore(self-improving-agent): sync from local"
sh ~/.agents/skills/github-sync-helper/scripts/gh_sync.sh push-main
```

### 4) Replace only the contents of a target file in the repository (preserve the original path and filename), then commit and push

Applicable scenarios: The user asks to "replace only the content," "replace only the worker inside," or "preserve the original repository filename/path." The intent is: **only overwrite the target file contents, without adding the source filename to the repository and without changing the target path in the repository**.

Recommended execution order:

```bash
# 1. Pull/refresh the repository
repo_dir=<workspace>/<repo>
if [ -d "$repo_dir/.git" ]; then
  cd "$repo_dir" && git fetch --all --prune && git reset --hard origin/main
else
  gh repo clone <owner/repo> "$repo_dir"
fi

# 2. Content-only overwrite: overwrite the target file in the repository with the source file contents
cp <source_file> "$repo_dir/<target_path>"

# 3. If the Git identity is not configured, prefer reusing the GitHub display name and GitHub noreply email
cd "$repo_dir"
git config user.name '<GitHubDisplay Name>'
git config user.email '<login>@users.noreply.github.com'

# 4. Commit and push directly to main (only when the user explicitly requests commit/push)
git add <target_path>
git commit -m 'replace <target_path> content'
git push origin main
```

Key points:
- When the user says "replace content only," always interpret it as: **preserve the original file path and filename in the repository, and overwrite only the content**.
- Do not put the source filename directly into the repository; the target should still be the original file in the repository, such as `worker.js`.
- If the target path is known, overwrite that path directly; if it is unknown, first locate the target file in the repository and then replace it.
- If `Author identity unknown` is reported before committing, you can write the following in the current repository:
  - `git config user.name '<GitHubDisplay Name>'`
  - `git config user.email '<login>@users.noreply.github.com'`
- By default, run `git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/main` first to avoid accidentally committing on an old working tree.
- If the user has already explicitly requested "commit" or "push," proceed directly without asking for confirmation again.

### 5) Delete all branches except main (local + remote)

```bash
sh ~/.agents/skills/github-sync-helper/scripts/gh_sync.sh delete-branches --keep main
```

### 6) Do not create a branch; open a PR directly from fork:main to upstream:main

```bash
sh ~/.agents/skills/github-sync-helper/scripts/gh_sync.sh pr \
  --upstream <owner/repo> \
  --head mowenyun:main \
  --base main \
  --title "sync: ..." \
  --body "..."
```

- **Repository list output must use a Markdown table** and include a `Number` column so the user can reply with a number to choose directly.
- Suggested fields: `Number | Repository(owner/repo) | Visibility | Fork | Default branch | Last updated | URL`
- Interaction suggestion: After the table, prompt: "Reply with the number to continue (clone/pull/commit and push/content-only replacement, etc.)."

> Note: If the user needs more fields (description, language, stars), add `--json ...` to extend the output.

| No. | Symptom | Handling |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | push reports `could not read Username` | Requires env `GITHUB_TOKEN`; the script will use `GIT_ASKPASS` for non-interactive authentication |
| 2 | API 401/403 | Insufficient token permissions (repo/public_repo) or token expired |
| 3 | `not inside a git repo` | First `cd` to the repository directory (or use `clone`/`init`) |
