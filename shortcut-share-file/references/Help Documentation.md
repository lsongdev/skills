## How It Works

```
User says "Share file"
       ↓
Speed test (checks the memory cache or runs an actual iperf3 test)
       ↓
Copy the file to the iCloud/Instant Share/ directory
       ↓
Calculate the estimated upload time → append the parameter --<time>Second
       ↓
Call the shortcuts:// URL scheme
       ↓
The shortcut automatically copies the share link to the clipboard
```

## Parameter Suffix Rules

| Source | Suffix | Example |
|------|------|------|
| Existing file in iCloud | `--0Second` | `Instant Share/Report.pdf--0Second` |
| attachments and other external sources | `--<seconds>Second` | `Instant Share/Photo.jpg--25Second` |

- Keep the original filename; pass Chinese characters directly
- `Second` represents the number of seconds, calculated as file size divided by measured upload speed

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Getting the message "iCloud directory does not exist"?**

A: First, mount iCloud as external storage and rename the folder to "iCloud." The shortcut will automatically create the `Instant Share` folder the first time it runs.

**Q: Will files remain in iCloud Drive after sharing?**

A: Yes. Files remain under `iCloud Drive/Instant Share/`. You can delete them manually if you need to clean them up.
